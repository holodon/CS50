4.  The "for" loop reads from the text file one character at a time until EOF. 
For every character it checks for the possibilities: 
    - all alphabetical characters (or '\'' when not at the first position) get added to a word buffer until reaching something else
    - all words longer than LENGTH get ignored (all their characters get read to advance in the file but then not processed)
    - all words containing numbers get ignored (like above)
After it fills a word in the buffer (sentence from alphabeticals followed by something else), adds '\0' to finish the string,
updates the counter and checks the word in the dictionary measuring the time needed to do so.
