1.  Header defining fixed width integer types.
2.  Better portability
3.  BYTE (uint8_t): 1 byte, DWORD (uint32_t): 4 bytes, LONG (int32_t): 4 bytes, WORD (uint16_t): 2 bytes 
4.  'BM', 19778, 0x4D42
5.  bfSize: The size, in bytes, of the bitmap file. biSize: The number of bytes required by the structure.
6.  biHeight negative: The bitmap is top-down
7.  biBitCount: bits per pixel
8.  If the file does not exists; or can't be read
9.  Read one block (BITMAPFILEHEADER or BITMAPINFOHEADER etc) at a time.
10. 3
11. Skips a few bytes in the file (in our case the padding)
12. Current position indicator in the opened file
